                                This deliverable focuses on the analysis, design and implementation of the 
                                VaxToDo:Re system based on the work done in deliverable 1. Specifically, the physical and conceptual requirements of the system were analyzed, and the 
                                system's performance was analyzed using activity diagrams. Then, a class diagram and sequence diagrams were used to design the system by paying 
                                attention to the classes, their interactions, their attributes and methods, and the order in which the classes interact with each other as a 
                                function of time. Finally, the system was implemented in Java, on the command line with a working prototype and a README user manual was written. 
                                Subsequently, a GUI interface was made with JavaFX, the diagrams were updated and unit tests were performed.

                    <p class="lead fw-normal text-muted mb-4">
                        The problem domain is the medical domain. The client does not know anything about computers. The client is the NPO GoodPeople which created the VaxTodo initiative, which vaccinates adults against COVID-19.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The problem is that the client has more and more problems meeting appointment dates and following up within an acceptable time frame. Our task is to create a system that will guarantee the periods of appointments booked and to facilitate the follow-up.
                    </p>
                    <h3 class="display-6 lh-1 mb-4">Prioritization</h3>
                    <p class="lead fw-normal text-muted mb-4">
                        Deliverable 1:
                        <br>
                        We first prioritized text analysis, client interviews and glossary in order to fully understand the area and the problem. Next, we prioritized the use case diagram in order to have a good basis for writing scenarios. Subsequently, we prioritized the writing of the scenarios. Then we worked on the analysis of risks and non-functional needs. Subsequently, we worked on the paper prototype and the Java prototype. Finally, we have completed the report.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Deliverable 2:
                        <br>
                        As with assignment 1, we first prioritized the analysis of the text in order to fully understand the problem. We then prioritized the analysis and correction of our Assignment 1, to ensure we were on the right track. Subsequently, we prioritized the design of the diagrams, in order to have a good understanding of how we were going to implement the system. It might have been easier to start with the activity diagram, but we started with the class diagram. We still worked on prototype at the same time prioritizing the design of classes, attributes, getters, setters and other methods without writing the methods in detail. After completing the diagrams, we worked on the prototype and wrote the material requirements, physical and conceptual requirements, and report.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Deliverable 3:
                        <br>
                        As with homework 1 and 2, we first prioritized the analysis of the text in order to fully understand the problem. We then prioritized the analysis and correction of our assignment 2, to ensure we were on the right track. Subsequently, we prioritized the VaxToDo application, to ensure that we did not have to modify the diagrams, README and report several times. Then we did the tests, and then we finalized the README, the report, and the diagrams.

                    <div class="lead fw-normal text-muted mb-4">
                        We had two meetings with the client. Before our first meeting, the client had already answered some questions from other developers.
                        <br>
                        At our first meeting, we asked four questions:
                        <ul class="lead fw-normal text-muted mb-4 bullet-list">
                            <li>
                                Are there any features you absolutely don't want to have?
                                <ul class="lead fw-normal text-muted mb-4">
                                    <li>
                                        The client has indicated that it does not wish to share vaccination data with any other authority.
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                What are your particular constraints regarding data storage, privacy (confidential medical information), etc.?
                                <ul class="lead fw-normal text-muted mb-4">
                                    <li>
                                        The client indicated that, for now, he wants to store the data on a computer at GoodPeople serving as a server, storing all the data at GoodPeople. The recordings will be stored on a text file on disk. Eventually, the client wants to migrate to a more robust solution.
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Are there any potential risks you see (security of confidential data, vaccination, etc.)?
                                <ul class="lead fw-normal text-muted mb-4">
                                    <li>
                                        The client has indicated that they want us to analyze these risks and offer solutions.
                                    </li>
                                </ul>

                            <li>
                                What is your strategy after launching the system (maintenance, support, feature additions, etc.)?
                                <ul class="lead fw-normal text-muted mb-4">
                                    <li>
                                        The client indicated that it eventually wants to migrate to a more robust solution for data storage and possibly migrate from a command-line system to a system with a graphical interface.
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                We see potential risks with the data storage system. We understand that your budget is limited and that this solution is the best possible for the current budget. However, it would be important to ensure that the computer serving as a server is secure. It is important not to place the server in the same room as other computers. Is there a place where the computer could be placed where use could be restricted? For example, a room used only for the server and well secured, which unauthorized employees could not access? It must be ensured that the identity documents of anyone wishing to access it are verified, for example by an ID card in addition to physical keys.
                                <ul class="lead fw-normal text-muted mb-4">
                                    <li>
                                        The client replied: You may be right, the server should be physically protected/isolated. If possible we would like to avoid having to resort to the consultant again. Our room has only one large room. Can you describe a simple solution?
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <span class="lead fw-normal text-muted mb-4">
                            One solution to this problem would be to keep the server locked, with only a few authorized employees having access to the key and ensuring that only certain employees have access to the server's system. This can be ensured with their 9-digit employee code, their usual password, as well as an additional password known by authorized employees to access the server.

                                <u>There could be a leak of confidential information of system users saved in the server, including medical data, if it was poorly secured.</u> <br> This risk is severe, as highly confidential information, such as the date of vaccination, the type of vaccine and the number of visitors' health insurance card are saved. A leak could allow some to illegally obtain visitors' vaccination passports, steal their identities or harass them.

                                <u>Improper use or saving of the questionnaire could result in a person being vaccinated with the wrong vaccine. </u> <br> For example, if a bug caused a problem with the questionnaire data and the questionnaire received by healthcare professionals had the wrong type of vaccine selected. This risk is significant, as it could violate the visitor's fundamental right to choice of treatment.

                                <u>If vaccination information is poorly saved, visitors may not have access to their vaccination passport.</u> <br> For example, if a bug caused a visitor's vaccination to be recorded as another visitor's vaccination or not recorded at all. This risk is significant because without a vaccine passport, a person would not be able to travel, access certain non-essential services or even work in some cases.

                        <h4 class="display-7 lh-1 mb-4" style="margin-top: 1rem;">1. Party to be computerized</h4>
                        <p class="lead fw-normal text-muted mb-4"> Since this is a small-volume application and the budget is limited, the best option is to use an interactive mode with on-site computers that will be used by employees. The part of appointment management (and calendar), account management of the volunteer and the visitor as well as the follow-up and vaccination report for each visitor will be computerized. </p>
                        <h4 class="display-7 lh-1 mb-4">2. Necessary equipment</h4>
                        <ul class="lead fw-normal text-muted mb-4">
                            <li> Computers on site. Since this is a rather simple software that does not require too much power, computers do not necessarily have to be very powerful. </li>
                            <li> Internal and external hard drives (optionally, to have copies). </li>
                            <li> Printer to be able to print calendars. Since these are not images that require very high quality, a jet or laser printer will do the job. However, we will recommend a laser printer, as this would be much more economical in the long run (more printing with a single cartridge). </li>
                        </ul>

                        <p class="lead fw-normal text-muted mb-4"> There will be a database that will save with the help of rows and columns all the important data and necessary for the use of the software. <br> The data will be stored in the src/Data/ folder in .csv format. <br> Everything will be saved on the hard drive of the computer and it will be possible to easily transfer the data to an external hard drive to have "back-ups". </p>

                        <h3 class="display-6 lh-1 mb-4">Physical and conceptual constraints</h3>
                        <p class="lead fw-normal text-muted mb-4"> There are a maximum of 15 visits per one-hour time slot (8am, 9am, ..., 4pm, 5pm), so a maximum of 150 visits per day, a maximum of 5 parallel visits, lasting 30 to 45 minutes each and a maximum of 40 visitors to the premises at the same time. The premises are open 10 hours a day, from 8am to 6pm. GoodPeople has a dozen computers, one of which will serve as a server. <br> <br> VaxToDo:Re, models and views have a size of <strong>~500 KB</strong>. <br> There are 8 csv files with an initial size of <strong>~50-140 B</strong>. <br> Each new item saved in a csv file takes <strong>~25-130 B</strong> depending on the number of boxes saved. <br> An employee or volunteer account takes <strong>~130 B</strong>. <br> Assuming that the total number of employees and volunteers is about 22 (because there are a dozen computers and one of them is used as a server, the premises are open 10 hours / day, 5 days / week, so 50 hours / week and it is assumed that the average working hours of employees and volunteers is 25 hours / week),  the total initial size of employee and volunteer accounts is <strong>~3.2 KB</strong>. <br> Thus, the initial size of the system (Java + csv) before taking into account visitors would be <strong>~1.3 MB</strong>. <br> Since a time slot lasts one hour and is limited to 15 appointments, assuming the worst case where each new appointment is a first visit, so where you have to create a new visitor account each time, you have to create 15 items per hour in the csv files Visitors, Follow-upVaccination, Appointments, ReportsVaccination, Interviews, Calendars. The maximum input volume per hour is therefore <strong>~9.6 KB/h</strong>. <br> There are 10 one-hour time slots per day (8am, 9am, ..., 4pm, 5pm). The maximum input volume per day is therefore <strong>~96 KB/day</strong>. <br> The premises are open 5 days/week, there are at most 22 weekdays (Monday to Friday) per month. The maximum input volume per month is therefore <strong>~2.1 MB/month</strong>. <br> There are no more than 252 non-statutory holiday weekdays in a year (if leap). The maximum volume of entries per year is therefore <strong>~532 MB/year</strong>. <br> <br> The hard disk of the server must have <strong>at least 4 GB</strong> to have an operating system such as a <strong>"mini Linux"</strong> system that can handle the command line, files and sending emails, and contain the equivalent of at least four years (~2 GB) of data. <br> Employees' and volunteers' computers must have <strong>hard drives of at least 1 GB</strong> to use a <strong>"mini Linux"</strong> operating system that can handle the command line and a connection to the server. <br> If GoodPeople eventually plans to increase its amount of employees, volunteers and visitors, add features to the system such as a graphical interface, etc., hard drives should be have more storage space. In this case, in order to take into account all possible situations, we would recommend <strong>hard drives of at least 32 GB</strong> for each computer with a modern operating system such as <strong>Linux Mint or Windows 10</strong>. </p>

                    <p class="lead fw-normal text-muted mb-4"> Our design allowed us to have a good understanding of how we were going to implement the VaxToDo:Re system, the classes and their interactions, the attributes, the methods and the order in which they interact with each other as a function of time. </p>

                        <h3 class="display-6 lh-1 mb-4">Justification of design choices: Abstraction, coupling and cohesion</h3>
                        <p class="lead fw-normal text-muted mb-4"> We aim for high cohesion. Our classes have limited special purposes. Each class has its own purpose. The majority of classes and interfaces have only one specific task. The VaxTodo interface has three: the management of appointments and accounts of volunteers and visitors. The menu takes care of displaying the text on the screen and allowing the user to select the menu options. Employees and volunteers have a code and password and interact with the menu. Visitor is used to manage visitors, their vaccination report and questionnaire. The latter two are implemented by classes that have only one identifier as well as attributes equivalent to the questions asked. Follow-upVaccination is used to manage the follow-up of the vaccination, including the sending of the vaccination reminder. <br> <br> We are aiming for a low coupling. We minimize relationships and dependency between classes. Changing something in one of the classes does not affect the others. The majority of classes have a connection with the Employe (employee) class, some also with Benevole (volunteer), as volunteers have restricted access. Some have a link to Visitor, only when the visitor is involved in the task for which the class serves. The rest are implementation relationships for the interface and inheritence relationships for the Person class. <br> <br> The Person class is used by Employe (employee), Benevole (volunteer), and Visiteur (Visitor), because several attributes are used by the other three classes. Also, the VaxTodo interface is implemented by Employe and Benevole, who use the system, and by Menu, which calls its methods when the user selects an option. We initially had a second Calendar interface with the printCalendrier() method and implemented by RendezVous, but we decided to simply place the method in RendezVous and return the list of appointments. </p>
