                                This deliverable focuses on the analysis, design and implementation of the 
                                VaxToDo:Re system based on the work done in deliverable 1. Specifically, the physical and conceptual requirements of the system were analyzed, and the 
                                system's performance was analyzed using activity diagrams. Then, a class diagram and sequence diagrams were used to design the system by paying 
                                attention to the classes, their interactions, their attributes and methods, and the order in which the classes interact with each other as a 
                                function of time. Finally, the system was implemented in Java, on the command line with a working prototype and a README user manual was written. 
                                Subsequently, a GUI interface was made with JavaFX, the diagrams were updated and unit tests were performed.

                            <p class="lead fw-normal text-muted mb-4">
                                The problem domain is the medical domain. The client does not know anything about computers. The client is the NPO GoodPeople which created the VaxTodo initiative, which vaccinates adults against COVID-19.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                The problem is that the client has more and more problems meeting appointment dates and following up within an acceptable time frame. Our task is to create a system that will guarantee the periods of appointments booked and to facilitate the follow-up.
                            </p>

                                Deliverable 1:
                                <br>
                                We first prioritized text analysis, client interviews and glossary in order to fully understand the area and the problem. Next, we prioritized the use case diagram in order to have a good basis for writing scenarios. Subsequently, we prioritized the writing of the scenarios. Then we worked on the analysis of risks and non-functional needs. Subsequently, we worked on the paper prototype and the Java prototype. Finally, we have completed the report.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Deliverable 2:
                                <br>
                                As with assignment 1, we first prioritized the analysis of the text in order to fully understand the problem. We then prioritized the analysis and correction of our Assignment 1, to ensure we were on the right track. Subsequently, we prioritized the design of the diagrams, in order to have a good understanding of how we were going to implement the system. It might have been easier to start with the activity diagram, but we started with the class diagram. We still worked on prototype at the same time prioritizing the design of classes, attributes, getters, setters and other methods without writing the methods in detail. After completing the diagrams, we worked on the prototype and wrote the material requirements, physical and conceptual requirements, and report.
                                <br>
                                <br>

                                As with homework 1 and 2, we first prioritized the analysis of the text in order to fully understand the problem. We then prioritized the analysis and correction of our assignment 2, to ensure we were on the right track. Subsequently, we prioritized the VaxToDo application, to ensure that we did not have to modify the diagrams, README and report several times. Then we did the tests, and then we finalized the README, the report, and the diagrams.

                                We had two meetings with the client. Before our first meeting, the client had already answered some questions from other developers.
                                <br>
                                At our first meeting, we asked four questions:
                                <ul class="lead fw-normal text-muted mb-4">
                                    <li>
                                        Are there any features you absolutely don't want to have?

                                                The client has indicated that it does not wish to share vaccination data with any other authority.
                                            </li>
                                        </ul>

                                    <li>
                                        What are your particular constraints regarding data storage, privacy (confidential medical information), etc.?
                                        <ul class="lead fw-normal text-muted mb-4">
                                            <li>
                                                The client indicated that, for now, he wants to store the data on a computer at GoodPeople serving as a server, storing all the data at GoodPeople. The recordings will be stored on a text file on disk. Eventually, the client wants to migrate to a more robust solution.
                                            </li>
                                        </ul>

                                        Are there any potential risks you see (security of confidential data, vaccination, etc.)?
                                        <ul class="lead fw-normal text-muted mb-4">

                                                The client has indicated that they want us to analyze these risks and offer solutions.
                                            </li>
                                        </ul>

                                    <li>
                                        What is your strategy after launching the system (maintenance, support, feature additions, etc.)?
                                        <ul class="lead fw-normal text-muted mb-4">
                                            <li>
                                                The client indicated that it eventually wants to migrate to a more robust solution for data storage and possibly migrate from a command-line system to a system with a graphical interface.
                                            </li>

                                    <li>
                                        We see potential risks with the data storage system. We understand that your budget is limited and that this solution is the best possible for the current budget. However, it would be important to ensure that the computer serving as a server is secure. It is important not to place the server in the same room as other computers. Is there a place where the computer could be placed where use could be restricted? For example, a room used only for the server and well secured, which unauthorized employees could not access? It must be ensured that the identity documents of anyone wishing to access it are verified, for example by an ID card in addition to physical keys.
                                        <ul class="lead fw-normal text-muted mb-4">
                                            <li>
                                                The client replied: You may be right, the server should be physically protected/isolated. If possible we would like to avoid having to resort to the consultant again. Our room has only one large room. Can you describe a simple solution?
                                            </li>
                                        </ul>

                                    One solution to this problem would be to keep the server locked, with only a few authorized employees having access to the key and ensuring that only certain employees have access to the server's system. This can be ensured with their 9-digit employee code, their usual password, as well as an additional password known by authorized employees to access the server.

                                spontaneous visit, the employee verifies that his name and phone number are present in 
                                the calendar at the time of the visit. The employee then asks for his or her account 
                                number to proceed with the questionnaire. If the visitor does not have his account 
                                number, he can provide his email address and date of birth to find it.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                The employee asks for the visitor's health insurance card and completes a 
                                questionnaire with the visitor in the system. If the visitor does not have a health 
                                card or if it has expired, the visit is cancelled and the employee invites the visitor 
                                to make a new appointment.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                In the case of a first dose, the employee asks the visitor if they would like to 
                                schedule a second dose. If so, the employee proceeds to schedule the appointment. The 
                                appointment must be made within a minimum of one month.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                The employee then prints and signs the form to be completed by a health care 
                                professional. During the day, an employee collects the completed forms and completes 
                                the visitor's vaccination profile. If the visitor has been vaccinated, an email is 
                                sent to the visitor containing the proof of vaccination in the form of a PDF document. 
                                The proof of vaccination contains the visitor's name, date of birth, a QR code and 
                                their vaccination profile listing the vaccinations given. At the end of the day, the 
                                employee retrieves the list of scheduled visits for the next 48 hours and sends an 
                                email notification, reminding everyone of their upcoming appointment.
