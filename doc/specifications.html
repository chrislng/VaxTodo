                    <div class="lead fw-normal text-muted mb-4">
                        When a person arrives at the reception desk, a volunteer checks to see if he or she 
                        has an appointment, using his or her reservation number and validating his or her 
                        name and appointment time in the system. If the person does not have an appointment 
                        or is late, the volunteer checks the calendar for available times. The volunteer 
                        confirms the period with the visitor and proceeds to add the visitor to the calendar 
                        at the selected period by indicating his name and phone number. If a person who has 
                        made an appointment arrives at the reception desk more than 15 minutes late, the 
                        appointment is automatically cancelled by the system and the person is considered 
                        a spontaneous visitor. The volunteer then proceeds to select an available period.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        When making the appointment, the employee uses the system to access the calendar 
                        to choose a date and time with the person. When the person confirms the choice to 
                        the employee, the employee makes the reservation and adds a scheduled visit to the 
                        calendar. The appointment details are emailed to the visitor, who can use them during 
                        their visit to confirm their appointment.

                    <div class="lead fw-normal text-muted mb-4">
                        During the interview with the employee, in the case of a scheduled visit, the employee 
                        asks for his reservation number and confirms his visit in the system. In the case of a 
                        spontaneous visit, the employee verifies that his name and phone number are present in 
                        the calendar at the time of the visit. The employee then asks for his or her account 
                        number to proceed with the questionnaire. If the visitor does not have his account 
                        number, he can provide his email address and date of birth to find it.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The employee asks for the visitor's health insurance card and completes a 
                        questionnaire with the visitor in the system. If the visitor does not have a health 
                        card or if it has expired, the visit is cancelled and the employee invites the visitor 
                        to make a new appointment.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        In the case of a first dose, the employee asks the visitor if they would like to 
                        schedule a second dose. If so, the employee proceeds to schedule the appointment. The 
                        appointment must be made within a minimum of one month.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The employee then prints and signs the form to be completed by a health care 
                        professional. During the day, an employee collects the completed forms and completes 
                        the visitor's vaccination profile. If the visitor has been vaccinated, an email is 
                        sent to the visitor containing the proof of vaccination in the form of a PDF document. 
                        The proof of vaccination contains the visitor's name, date of birth, a QR code and 
                        their vaccination profile listing the vaccinations given. At the end of the day, the 
                        employee retrieves the list of scheduled visits for the next 48 hours and sends an 
                        email notification, reminding everyone of their upcoming appointment.
